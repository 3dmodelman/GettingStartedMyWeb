## Markdown Files on Stackoverflow

[What file uses .md extension and how should I edit them?]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5922882/what-file-uses-md-extension-and-how-should-i-edit-them

Markdown is a plain-text file format. The extensions .md and .markdown are just text files written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax. If you have a README.md in your repo, GitHub will show the contents on the home page of your repo. Read the documentation:

* [Standard Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
* [Writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/categories/writing-on-github/)

...
If you want to create an md file with preview and if you prefer not to install any special editors, you can use online editors like [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/) and [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/). They provide live preview. You can also export your files to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) or [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/).


## Markdown Files on Wikipedia

[Markdown]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown.
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.[8] Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

### Example Markdown Syntax

# Heading - Largest
## Heading - Second Largest 
###### Heading - Smallest

Paragraphs are separated
by a blank line.

Two spaces at the end of a line  
produces a line break.

Text attributes _italic_, **bold**, `monospace`.

Horizontal rule:

---

Bullet list:

  * apples
  * oranges
  * pears

Numbered list:

  1. wash
  2. rinse
  3. repeat
